# Obsidian_Templates

This is the repo where I contain all templates I work on/develop.

So far, as of 10/04/2023, the only one I feel is necessary to share on GitHub is my daily log template. It's a work in progress but I am at least somewhat proud of it.

It was partially inspired by [this post](https://dannb.org/blog/2022/obsidian-daily-note-template/), but also a few others which may need to remain uncredited because, quite frankly, I did not remember to make note of them (oops.)

But it's otherwise pretty self-explanatory. The only thing I will say is that the "Habits" section is obviously customizable, though you're welcome to try to do my habits. I don't do all of these habits everyday, obviously; I am not that productive, but I am trying to do at least some of them, and then, over time, prune the ones I evidently am not prioritizing. I would also like to eventually include a tracker but that's been a bit more difficult to optimize.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or improvements!
